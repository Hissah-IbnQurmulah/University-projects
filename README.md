# University-projects 

This section showcases my academic projects completed during my studies at **King Saud University**.  
Each project reflects my growth in **Computer Science** and my passion for applying **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Web Development** concepts to real-world problems.  
Through these projects, I have gained hands-on experience in programming, data analysis, and building intelligent systems from small scale algorithms to advanced deep learning models.
