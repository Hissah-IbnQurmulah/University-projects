      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I'm a Computer Science student at
        <a href="https://www.ksu.edu.sa" target="_blank" class="uni-link">
          (<abbr class="bold" title="King Saud University">KSU</abbr>).

      <p>
        I've always had an interest in technology, but my real passion started
        to grow around <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> and
        <strong>Machine Learning</strong>. I’ve been learning, reading, and
        exploring how we can use these tools to create real solutions that help
        people and support our growth as a society.
      </p>

      <p>
        I truly believe these fields play a big role in achieving
        <strong>Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030</strong>, and that’s why I keep
        working on improving myself day by day.

      <p>
        I really hope to be one of those dreamers helping to build a better
        future.

          <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
          <p>
            Artificial Intelligence is the field I aspire to pursue in my
            professional career. My interest in AI began even before I
            specialized in Computer Science. The first course I took in this
            field was <strong>CSC 361</strong>, which was an enjoyable subject
            that opened the door for me to explore the depth and diversity of
            AI. Later, I studied <strong>CSC 462</strong>, a course that truly
            refined my skills and confirmed that AI is the field I want to
            continue and grow in.
          </p>

          <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
          <p>
            I find Cyber Security to be an exciting field filled with puzzles
            and challenges. It strongly connects to the rapid advancements we
            witness in our modern era — the era of technology.
          </p>


        <!-- Web Development -->
        <div class="interest-card">
          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            My passion for web development began with my curiosity about how
            websites are designed and how we interact with them. Nowadays,
            almost every aspect of our daily life is connected to a website —
            whether it's universities, stores, hospitals, or even government and
            official services. I started taking some external courses to learn
            more about this field, and what increased my excitement even more is
            that I’m currently studying <strong>CSC 457</strong> this semester.
